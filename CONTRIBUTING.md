# Contributing

We use GitHub to track the progress of new requests to the website and we have two template issues that can be used to request new pages or suggest edits to existing content. 

## To suggest an update or correction on existing content

E.g., you spotted a typo or need to update a team members’ information

1. **Go to the [Catalyst website GitHub repository](https://github.com/czi-catalystproject/czi-catalystproject.github.io)**
2. From the top menu, **click on Issues**. You will see a list of [ongoing issues](https://github.com/czi-catalystproject/czi-catalystproject.github.io/issues)
3. **Click on the green “New Issue” button** and then **select the template called “Suggest minor edits”.**
4. This will display a template issue where you can **add your request details**
5. Tip: Please add a direct link to the place on the website that you would like to be updated. If you hover over headings on the website this will reveal an anchored URL. This will help the website team to find the correct place.
6. When you have added all the required info, **click the “submit new issue” button**
7. You can expect @jnywong to respond to your issue within a week. She may ask clarifying questions in the issue comment so please make sure you have notifications enabled. @jnywong will likely package multiple issues into a next release so you may not see a resolution to your issue immediately.

## To suggest a brand new static page (not a blog post)

E.g., a sub-team needs to request a new page

1. **Go to the [Catalyst website GitHub repository](https://github.com/czi-catalystproject/czi-catalystproject.github.io)**
2. From the top menu, **click on Issues**. You will see a list of [ongoing issues](https://github.com/czi-catalystproject/czi-catalystproject.github.io/issues)
3. **Click on the green “New Issue” button** and then **select the template called “Add a new page to the website”.**
4. This will display a template issue where you can **add your request details**
5. Tip: Please provide as much background information as you currently have e.g., link out to Google docs. The website team may need to coordinate a meeting with you to determine next steps.
6. When you have added all the required info, **click the “submit new issue” button**
7. You can expect that @tajuddeen1 and @katiepratt will follow up with you within a week to discuss next steps, which may include: 
    - Scheduling a meeting with you to discuss your proposed content
    - Asking clarifying questions about your request
    - Creating a new draft page and requesting your feedback
