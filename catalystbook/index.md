# The Catalyst Project

The Catalyst Project is a community-engaged initiative designed to support the adoption of open science principles in under-served bioscience research communities through the provision of reliable and sustainable cloud computing infrastructure.

The project, which is funded by the [Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI)](https://chanzuckerberg.com/), is a collaboration between  seven organisations, who bring the  breadth of open science skills and backgrounds needed. These include expertise in: technology deployment, community building and governance, training development and delivery, as well as organisations with  existing connections in our partner locations.

Our work is continuously influenced by contextual feedback from the bioscience researchers, engineers, and computer scientists that we serve in Africa and Latin America.

## Catalyst Project Service

The Catalyst Project continues to provide cloud computing infrastructure to researchers and educators in Africa and Latin America. 2i2c seeks to work with communities to find mechanisms to extend their service period. This may include options to:

- Enter into new partnership service agreements (between 2i2c and communities)
- Help communities identify funding (and where possible, collaborate to co-write grants)
