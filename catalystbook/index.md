# The Catalyst Project

The Catalyst Project is a community-engaged initiative designed to support the adoption of open science principles in under-served biomedical research communities through the provision of reliable and sustainable cloud computing infrastructure. 

The project, which is funded by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), is a collaboration between  seven organisations, who bring the  breadth of open science skills and backgrounds needed. These include expertise in: technology deployment, community building and governance, training development and delivery, as well as organisations with  existing connections in our partner locations. 

Our work is continuously influenced by contextual feedback from the biomedical researchers, engineers, and computer scientists that we serve in Africa and Latin America.
