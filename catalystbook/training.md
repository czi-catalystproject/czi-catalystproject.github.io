# Training

The Catalyst Project offers three training opportunities for Community Partners. These are designed to offer participants technical training in maintaining their local cloud computing hub, the skills to pass on that knowledge to others in their community, and the opportunity to connect and learn alongside the global open science community.

## Hub Champion Training

**For:** Hub Champions \

- Learn how to access and manage 2i2c cloud infrastructure
- Receive access to documentation that they can refer back to and share with their members
- Contribute to the development of additional resources by participating in feedback interviews during the workshop

**Time commitment:** This workshop will be delivered over the course of a week, with participants joining two, 1-hour sessions at the beginning and end of the week. During the week, participants complete self-study sessions at their own pace. 

In combination with the Train-the-Trainer workshop, participants in this training will be equipped to convene additional training sessions within their communities.

## Train the Trainer Workshop

**For:** Hub Champions \
**Hosted by:** The Carpentries \

**About:** This training will support individuals in gaining the skills they need to train others in their community on administering a 2i2c cloud hub. Participants will: 
- Explore evidence-based teaching practices
- Learn how to create a positive environment for learners at workshops and training events
- Practise and build teaching skills
- Discuss how these practices apply in their local communities, and how they might be modified or adapted

**Time commitment:** This workshop comprises a series of online modules that learners can complete in 1-2 days with 6 hours per day. 

After the Hub Champions take both the Hub Champion training and the “Train the Trainer” workshop, they will have everything they need to organise similar training activities within their communities.
