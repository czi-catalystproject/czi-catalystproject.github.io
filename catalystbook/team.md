CCAD is the HPC centre of the National University of Córdoba, Argentina. CCAD has a tradition of bottom-up development in HPC. We solve the computational needs of the science and technology community at the university. We believe in computing as a way to push science in the Global South – we do a lot with a little.

**Catalyst Project role:** CCAD is in charge of the secondment of an open infrastructure engineer at 2i2c, to learn how to deploy community hubs. This is also an opportunity for 2i2c to learn if their approach is replicable in on-premises computing infrastructure.
