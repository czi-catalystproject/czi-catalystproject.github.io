This lesson is aimed at Hub Champions in charge of their community’s 2i2c managed JupyterHubs in the cloud. Workshop attendees will learn the fundamentals of administering their hub and providing user support to their research and education communities.

Training will be delivered over two synchronous workshops, each one hour in length a week apart. The week between sessions will be dedicated to self-guided study with asynchronous support provided by the instructors.

After participating in the workshop, Hub Champions will be able to:

- explain how interactive cloud computing can empower their user community
- control user authentication and access to their hub
- promote the use of cloud resources responsibly to maximize efficiency and minimize carbon emissions
- apply software environments through containerization
- navigate the filesystem and transfer data and code to and from the hub
- provide user support and troubleshoot common issues

We plan to deliver a Spanish version of the workshop in June, 2024. Date and time to be determined.

If you are a Hub Champion of a Catalyst partner community and would like to participate, then please contact the instructor, Jenny Wong, at [jwong@2i2c.org](mailto:jwong@2i2c.org).
