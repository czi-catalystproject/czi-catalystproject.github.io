We're excited to share some reflections from our Hub Champion Training program delivered to our partner communities of The Catalyst Project! This program aims to provide new Hub Champions with skills and tools to help them onboard their communities to make the best use of their 2i2c-operated JupyterHub for research and education.

The English version of the training was [held earlier this year in April](./2024-04-hub-champion-training.md) while the Spanish version of the training was [recently delivered in August](./2024-06-21-entrenamiento-de-hub.md). The workshop was delivered over two synchronous workshops, each one hour in length and a week apart. The week in between is dedicated to self-guided study with asynchronous support provided by the instructors.

## Learning outcomes

Trainees were provided with the tools and knowledge to:

- explain how interactive cloud computing can empower their user community
- control user authentication and access to their hub
- promote the use of cloud resources responsibly to maximize efficiency and minimize carbon emissions
- apply software environments through containerization
- navigate the filesystem and transfer data and code to and from the hub
- provide user support and troubleshoot common issues

## Participation and engagement

13 out of 19 partner communities took advantage of the training program. Given the spread of time zones of the learners, scheduling the synchronous sessions was a challenge. We accommodated this by splitting the program into an English version and a Spanish version that was time-zone friendly for African and Latin American communities respectively.

To facilitate accessibility and inclusivity we decided to record all synchronous sessions. There were often times when participants would drop out of video calls due to poor internet connections or sometimes last-minute scheduling conflicts would crop up. Learners were appreciative of having a video recording to refer back to in the future and this also helped with mitigating the cognitive load incurred from learning in a non-native language.

## Lessons learned

For the [Spanish version](https://catalystproject.cloud/hub-champion-training/es/index.html) of the training, we localized the lesson content. This helped with accessibility and made it easier for learners to follow the lessons in their native language. We used a third-party translation service called Crowdin, which allowed us to turn around translated content quickly. The overall experience was very positive and one of the lessons we learned is that Spanish translations of technical topics are hard! Technical phrases such as "upstreaming open-source developments" were difficult to contextualize. Domain knowledge and language expertise from MetaDocencia and CCAD were crucial for the proofreading stage.

Learners were also expected to undertake a significant portion of the course at their own pace. A collaborative note-taking document (CodiMD) was used to write down answers to exercises. However, this tool may not have been the best way to maintain engagement and it was difficult to measure progress. Another option for the future could be to use a Learning Management System (LMS) like Moodle, to provide a more structured experience and feedback on progress.

## Final thoughts

We are super pleased with how well the learners improved their JupyterHub administration skills with the Hub Champion Training and we hope that they will continue to benefit from The Catalyst Project with the follow-up Train the Trainer given by The Carpentries and the [Open Seeds Program](https://we-are-ols.org/openseeds/) given by OLS.

We acknowledge the incredible support of [Toby Hodges (The Carpentries)](../people.md#the-carpentries) for providing the framework for designing this lesson with their [Collaborative Lesson Development Training](https://carpentries.org/lesson-development-training/) and invaluable support from [Sabrina LÃ³pez (MetaDocencia)](../people.md#metadocencia) and [Alejandro Silva (CCAD, secondee at 2i2c)](../people.md#ccad) to deliver the Spanish version of this lesson, as well as our wonderful community partners for participating in The Catalyst Project. We are also grateful to The Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative for the financial support.
