# Community Partner Highlight - MolerHealth

*This blog post is part of a series highlighting the [Catalyst Project’s Community Partners](../current-community-partners.md), who are using the Catalyst Project cloud infrastructure to further various projects in the biosciences. Community Partners also play a vital role in shaping our governance model to help us sustain, scale and maximise impact in Latin America, Africa, and under-served communities around the world.*

In this blog post, Onabajo Monsurat shares how partnering with the Catalyst Project is impacting MolerHealth in Nigeria.

**Could you introduce yourself to our readers? Tell us about your organisation/institute/project and the research the members of your community are working on right now.**

My name is Monsurat Onabajo, and I am the founder of MolerHealth, a community focused on revolutionising healthcare in Nigeria by developing an accessible electronic health record (EHR) system aimed at reducing disease misdiagnosis. Our system incorporates artificial intelligence to assist in predicting patient diagnoses more accurately, which we believe will significantly improve the quality of care provided.

Through the Catalyst Project’s cloud infrastructure, we aim to leverage cutting-edge technology to build a robust EHR platform that can be used nationwide. Our primary research goals revolve around optimising patient data management and improving diagnostic accuracy through AI integration. The Catalyst Project cloud infrastructure is instrumental in helping us streamline this process, providing us with the tools and support needed to achieve these outcomes.

Currently, our community consists of 12 dedicated individuals who are actively developing the project. However, we anticipate that within a year of launching the platform, over 1,000,000 people will be interacting with the system, as we scale and expand its reach across Nigeria.

“The Catalyst Project has been instrumental in accelerating our work at MolerHealth. Access to training, like The Carpentries Instructor Training, has empowered our team with essential skills for effective teaching and collaboration. We anticipate that this partnership will significantly enhance our ability to develop impactful healthcare solutions and scale our outreach across Nigeria.”

**What are you specifically using the cloud infrastructure for? What kinds of data are stored there? What software packages does your community use?**

Our community's technology is divided into AI, Frontend, and Backend. For our AI development, we utilise the [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) framework for training our vision models, which detect data in medical reports and translate it into a digital form that can be stored and uploaded to the MolerHealth database. We are currently also training our large language model, which is fine-tuned using medical data and information. The model can then be used for early detection of underlying medical problems that might otherwise be missed and left untreated. For our frontend application, we are making use of the popular platform [React](https://react.dev/), which enables seamless interaction with our backend service. Along with a clean and crisp user interface, React also provides robust security with regular updates and patches. For our backend service, we use [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) because of its active user community and contributors, robust security, ease of use, and maintenance and versatility. We have also adopted a micro service architecture which helps us separate different business logics.

**Can you tell us about your experience with the Catalyst Project so far? E.g., have you participated in any training options through Catalyst? What have you enjoyed most so far?**

Both I and a member of my community have completed The Carpentries Instructor Training through the Catalyst Project. The training has been valuable in enhancing our teaching skills, and we plan to apply these insights to our future workshops on electronic health records, data management, and AI in healthcare. It's been a great experience, and we're eager to put what we've learned into practice.
