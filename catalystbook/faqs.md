## Hub FAQs

### When can I start using the hub?

You can use the hub as soon as it is deployed! Please see the [List of Hubs](./current-community-partners.md#list-of-hubs) to find the URL of your hub.

### How do I get started with the hub?

Please take the [Hub Champion Training](https://catalystproject.cloud/hub-champion-training/) course for an introduction to administering your hub for your community.

### Who can access the hub?

Any collaborator or learner associated with your institution can use the hub for research and education purposes.

### What is the maximum number of users allowed on the hub?

There is no maximum capacity. 2i2c can deploy hubs in the cloud that can scale resources for as many users as you need. The Catalyst Project funds cover the resource costs.

### What's the maximum storage capacity on the hub?

Again, the same answer as the above applies. We advise extra caution here since storage costs can be expensive. Please consult the [2i2c Service Guide – Data and Filesystem](https://docs.2i2c.org/user/topics/data/) for guidance.

### Can I store sensitive data, such as health records and patient information, on the hub?

No, we do not recommend that you store sensitive data on the hub for security reasons. Data must be handled according to local regulatory and legal frameworks. Consider engaging with others to help you define policies, processes and systems for working safely with sensitive data. See [The Turing Way – Sensitive Data Projects](https://book.the-turing-way.org/project-design/sdp) for an overview of managing sensitive research data.

### Are GPU computing resources available?

This feature is not available on all Catalyst hubs by default. We are happy to enable GPUs for your hub if required – please contact [2i2c support](https://docs.2i2c.org/support/).

### Is shared object storage available?

This feature is not available on all Catalyst hubs by default. We are happy to enable [shared object storage](https://docs.2i2c.org/user/topics/data/object-storage/) for your hub if required – please contact [2i2c support](https://docs.2i2c.org/support/).

### How do I install software on the hub?

We provide two standard community-maintained software images for all Catalyst hubs:

1. [Jupyter SciPy Notebook](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/selecting.html#jupyter-scipy-notebook)
1. [Rocker Geospatial with RStudio](https://rocker-project.org/images/)

We also provide a third option for you to "Bring your own image" to the hub. [See the 2i2c Service Guide – Customize a community-maintained upstream image](https://docs.2i2c.org/admin/howto/environment/customize-image/) for guidance on how you can add packages to an existing image.
