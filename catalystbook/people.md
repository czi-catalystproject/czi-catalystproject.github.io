Chris is the Executive Director of 2i2c and PI of the Catalyst Project. He was previously a post-doctoral researcher in the Department of Statistics at UC Berkeley, and a Community Architect with the Division of Data Science at Berkeley. He is also a team member of Project Jupyter (particularly the JupyterHub and Binder teams), with a focus on how infrastructure can support interactive computing workflows in research and education. He’s interested in the boundary between technology, open-source software, and research and education workflows, as well as how open communities can support and extend these workflows in a way that makes science more impactful and inclusive. His background is in cognitive and computational neuroscience, where he used predictive models to understand the auditory system in the human brain.

James is the Community Success Manager for 2i2c. Coming from a background as an associate professor in the Department of Physics and Physical Oceanography at Memorial University of Newfoundland, he is a strong advocate for enabling scientists and students to be efficient and effective in their computational workflows. Building on previous work in big data oceanography with links to the Pangeo project, COSIMA : Consortium for Ocean-Sea Ice Modelling in Australia, and CIOOS : Canadian Integrated Ocean Observing System, James wants to bring the strength of the Jupyter ecosystem to users across a broad range of educational and research domains.
