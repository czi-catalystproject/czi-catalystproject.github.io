Chris is the Executive Director of 2i2c and PI of the Catalyst Project. He was previously a post-doctoral researcher in the Department of Statistics at UC Berkeley, and a Community Architect with the Division of Data Science at Berkeley. He is also a team member of Project Jupyter (particularly the JupyterHub and Binder teams), with a focus on how infrastructure can support interactive computing workflows in research and education. He’s interested in the boundary between technology, open-source software, and research and education workflows, as well as how open communities can support and extend these workflows in a way that makes science more impactful and inclusive. His background is in cognitive and computational neuroscience, where he used predictive models to understand the auditory system in the human brain.
